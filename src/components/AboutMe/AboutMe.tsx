          Hey! I&#39;m a frontend developer passionate about building scalable
          websites and applications. I focus on delivering exceptional user
          experiences, beautiful interfaces, and seamless developer workflows.
          <span className="hidden sm:inline">
            {" "}
            I thrive at the intersection of design and engineering—creating
            products that are both visually appealing and technically sound.
          </span>

          Outside of coding, you&#39;ll often find me diving into books or exploring
          immersive online games. I’m always curious and love learning through
          creativity and collaboration.
